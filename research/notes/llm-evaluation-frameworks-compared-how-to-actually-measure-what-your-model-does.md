In this article, you will learn how to evaluate LLM applications using the three dominant open-source frameworks — RAGAS, DeepEval, and Promptfoo — and why the LLM-as-a-judge mechanism they all rely on has measurable biases you need to actively design around.
Topics we will cover include:
How RAGAS, DeepEval, and Promptfoo differ in purpose and when to use each one, including which pairings experienced teams converge on.
How to implement a faithfulness check and a CI-gated quality evaluation with working code you can run immediately.
What position bias, self-preference bias, and verbosity bias are, how to detect them with an audit harness, and how to mitigate them in production.
There’s a lot to get through, so let’s get right into it.
Introduction
You ship an LLM feature after seeing a couple of outputs and decide it looks good. Three weeks later, a prompt tweak silently breaks something nobody was testing for, and nobody notices until a user complains. This is the default failure mode for LLM applications, and it’s different from a typical software bug. Traditional code fails with a stack trace. LLM outputs fail by being confidently, plausibly wrong, which is exactly the kind of failure a quick manual glance won’t catch.
Three open-source tools dominate the practical side of this problem in 2026:
Promptfoo, DeepEval, and RAGAS
. Each is built for a different shape of problem, not competing for the same job. Layered above them are production-monitoring platforms like LangSmith and Braintrust, which pick up where offline evaluation leaves off. None of these tools wins outright; most mature GenAI QA programs run two of them in parallel: a lightweight framework for blocking bad deploys plus a platform for ongoing monitoring and human review.
This article compares the frameworks that actually matter, walks through tested code for the two most common evaluation jobs, and covers the part most comparison pieces skip entirely: the fact that “
LLM-as-a-judge
“, the mechanism nearly every framework here relies on, has measurable, published biases you need to design around, not just trust.
What “Evaluating an LLM” Actually Means
Before comparing tools, it helps to separate three things people conflate when they say “
LLM evaluation
.” Picking the wrong category here is the single most common mistake teams make.
Model benchmarking
compares raw model capabilities on standardized academic tasks, such as MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval.
lm-evaluation-harness is the standard here, with no real substitute when the requirement is a standardized academic benchmark
. If you’re choosing between GPT-5 and Claude for a new project, this is the category you want, but it tells you almost nothing about whether your specific application works.
Application evaluation
asks a narrower, more useful question: does your RAG pipeline, chatbot, or agent produce correct, grounded, safe outputs on your data and your prompts? This is where RAGAS, DeepEval, and Promptfoo live, and it’s where this article spends most of its time.
Production monitoring
tracks live traffic after deployment, catching regressions and drift that offline test sets never anticipated. This is LangSmith, Braintrust, and Arize Phoenix territory.
Most people asking “
which eval framework should I use
” actually need the second category, often paired with the third. The rest of this article focuses on that.
The Metrics Underneath the Frameworks
Before the framework comparison makes sense, it’s worth knowing what’s actually being scored, because every tool below implements some version of the same handful of metrics.
Faithfulness (or groundedness)
checks whether an answer contains only claims supported by the retrieved context — the core mechanism for catching RAG hallucinations.
Context precision and recall
check whether retrieval pulled the right documents, and only the right ones, before generation even happens.
Answer relevancy
checks whether the response actually addresses the question asked, independent of whether it’s factually grounded.
G-Eval
, introduced by
Liu et al.
, uses chain-of-thought prompting combined with form-filling to guide an LLM judge through an explicit rubric, and has been shown to align with human preference more closely than naive “
rate this 1-10
” prompting. Beyond these, most frameworks add task-specific checks for toxicity, bias, and PII leakage.
The real differentiator between frameworks isn’t metric novelty; they mostly implement the same handful of ideas. It’s workflow fit: how the metric gets triggered, where the result goes, and whether it blocks a deploy or just generates a report.
RAGAS vs. DeepEval vs. Promptfoo, Head to Head
RAGAS is research-backed, with academic-grade methodology behind metrics like faithfulness, context precision, and context recall, but it’s scoped to retrieval and generation scoring, with no production monitoring or collaboration layer built in. Pick it when your architecture is retrieval-heavy and you want metrics with a published paper behind their definition, not just a vendor’s internal heuristic.
DeepEval
is Python-native and pytest-based, with 14-plus metrics spanning hallucination, bias, toxicity, and RAG-specific checks — built explicitly to function as a CI/CD quality gate that can block a deploy. Pick it when evaluation needs to live inside your existing test suite rather than as a separate offline report someone has to remember to run.
Promptfoo
is CLI-first and YAML-config-driven, strongest at multi-model prompt comparison and adversarial red-teaming, with 500-plus built-in attack vectors in its security-testing suite. Pick it for prompt engineering iteration across multiple models, or when red-teaming and security testing are the actual requirement.
The framing that matters most: DeepEval and RAGAS aren’t really competitors. DeepEval covers broad LLM application testing, RAGAS specializes specifically in RAG, and a meaningful share of production teams run both together — with RAGAS scoring the retrieval-specific dimensions and DeepEval handling everything else inside the same CI pipeline.

Code Walkthrough: Catching Hallucination with a Faithfulness Check
Here’s the mechanism behind RAGAS’s faithfulness metric, demonstrated directly: decompose an answer into atomic claims, then check each claim against the retrieved context. A claim with no support in the context is a hallucination — exactly the failure mode that a quick manual read tends to miss, because the unsupported detail often sounds completely plausible.

That population figure sounds entirely reasonable, which is exactly why a manual review would likely let it through. The faithfulness check catches it because it’s checking against the actual retrieved context, not against general plausibility. This is the mechanism running underneath
RAGAS’s real Faithfulness metric
, which uses an LLM to do the claim decomposition and support-checking instead of keyword overlap — more accurate, same underlying logic.

Code Walkthrough: CI-Gated Evaluation with DeepEval

The first test should pass; the response matches a plausible, unembellished policy statement. The second is written to demonstrate a likely failure: it adds conditions that weren’t part of the original input, which a well-configured G-Eval rubric should catch and score below the 0.7 threshold. In a real CI pipeline, that failure blocks the merge — exactly the behavior that turns evaluation from “
something we should check on
” into “
something the pipeline enforces
.”
The Problem Nobody Mentions: LLM-as-a-Judge Is Biased
Every framework above relies on the same underlying mechanism for the metrics that matter most: an LLM judging another LLM’s output. That judge is not neutral, and the research on this is more developed than most teams realize.
Position bias
is the best-documented of these. A
systematic study at IJCNLP 2025
evaluated 15 LLM judges across roughly 150,000 evaluation instances and found that judges systematically favor whichever response sits in a particular slot of the prompt, and that this effect is not attributable to random chance. Swap the order of two responses being compared, and the same judge can flip its verdict purely because of where each response now sits — not because either response changed.
Self-preference
bias compounds this.
Models disproportionately favor outputs generated by themselves or by models in their own family
, meaning that if you use GPT-4o to judge GPT-4o’s own outputs, the resulting score is inflated above what an independent judge would assign. Research distinguishes this from genuine quality differences: not every self-preference signal is biased, but the harmful version is specifically when a judge fails to penalize its own model family’s errors.
Verbosity bias
is the third major one:
longer responses get rated higher independent of whether the added length contains anything useful
. A judge comparing a concise, correct answer against a padded, partially redundant one will often favor the longer one.
The often-cited statistic that LLM judges reach roughly 80% agreement with human evaluators comes from the original MT-Bench study and is accurate as an aggregate figure, but it describes average performance across a broad benchmark — not reliability on your specific task with your specific judge model. Treating that number as a production-readiness guarantee is the mistake.

A 55% flip rate is a severe case used here for clarity; most real judges aren’t this biased, but even a flip rate in the 10–15% range — which shows up regularly in production judge setups — is enough to make a borderline pass/fail decision unreliable. The fix costs one extra LLM call per evaluation: run both orderings and average, or, more robustly, use a judge model from a different family than whichever model produced the responses being scored, which directly addresses the self-preference issue at the same time.
Choosing Your Stack
There’s no universal answer here, but the decision tree is fairly clean once you know what you’re building:
RAG application
: start with RAGAS for the retrieval-specific metrics (faithfulness, context precision, context recall). Add DeepEval alongside it if you need broader coverage of toxicity, bias, and general correctness in the same test suite.
General chatbot or content-generation feature with CI requirements
: DeepEval, run as part of your existing pytest suite, gating merges on a quality threshold.
Prompt iteration across multiple models, or security/red-teaming
: Promptfoo. Its YAML-driven config makes multi-model comparison fast, and its built-in attack suite is the most complete open-source option for adversarial testing.
Production tracing and human review after deployment
: LangSmith if your stack is already built on LangChain or LangGraph; Braintrust if your stack is more heterogeneous and you want a platform that isn’t coupled to one framework.
The pattern experienced teams converge on is two tools, not one: a lightweight framework for CI-time gating, paired with a platform for ongoing monitoring, regression tracking, and the human annotation that no automated metric fully replaces.
Conclusion
No framework here wins outright, because they’re not solving the same problem. RAGAS, DeepEval, and Promptfoo each fit a different shape of evaluation need, and the real architectural decision is usually “
which two of these do I run together
,” not “
which one is best.
”
The bigger risk isn’t picking the wrong tool from this list; it’s trusting whatever score an LLM judge produces without checking it for the biases documented above. Position bias, self-preference, and verbosity bias aren’t edge cases buried in an academic paper; they’re measurable effects that show up in ordinary judge setups, including the ones inside the very frameworks this article just walked through. The frameworks give you the scoring mechanism. The audit habit in the position-bias section is what makes the resulting number worth trusting.
